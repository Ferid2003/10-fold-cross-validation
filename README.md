# 10-fold-cross-validation
The project uses IMDb data of top 200 film of all time to create dataset and then uses it to do regression and classification to find whether the film won Oscar or not.

It is recommened to run the program from 3-rd cell because IMDb website language may vary depending on the caountry.
